# Ketchup Bot

A Discord bot with ketchup as the currency.

This code for this bot was originally based off of Discord's tutorial for hosting a bot off Cloudflare Workers, which can be found [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/hosting-on-cloudflare-workers).

Some code is also based off of [`Bristlefrost1/puddleshine`](https://github.com/Bristlefrost1/puddleshine) (now-shut down, RIP), and the reminder functionality is derived from my bot [`reminder-bot`](https://github.com/rustykitty/reminder-bot).
